Welcome to **Printilan**, an innovative e-commerce platform designed to help college students reduce waste and save money by selling and buying pre-loved items. The app focuses on waste management by making it easier for students to give a second life to items they no longer need, all while contributing to environmental sustainability.

### 💡 About Printilan

Printilan is a **Native Desktop Application** for Windows, specifically tailored for college students living in dormitories.

The Printilan app addresses the issue of waste accumulation in dormitories by creating a platform that facilitates the sale and purchase of second-hand goods. This not only helps reduce the amount of waste generated but also provides an economically viable option for students. The app's design is influenced by popular e-commerce platforms like Shopee and Tokopedia but with a specific focus on sustainability and the student market.

### 🔗 Similar Solutions
While Printilan is unique in its focus on the dormitory market, it shares similarities with broader e-commerce platforms like Bukalapak or Tokopedia.

These platforms inspire the core functionality but Printilan differentiates itself with its focus on waste reduction and sustainability within the student community.
